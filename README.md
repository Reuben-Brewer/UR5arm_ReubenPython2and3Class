# UR5arm_ReubenPython2and3Class
Code (including ability to hook to Tkinter GUI) to control Universal Robotics UR5 robot arm (with Controller Box 2 or 3). Code has NOT been tested on the newer "E"-series UR5e. However, the code should work for the most part on other sizes of arm (e.g. UR10, UR16, etc.)
